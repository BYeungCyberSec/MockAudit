Using https://www.smartsheet.com/content/iso-27001-checklist-templates for the ISO27001 checklist template.

For a simple configuration that we've done before, we will be using the ISO27001 checklist to ensure the organisation and its' systems are compliant with ISO27001.

Of course, as the organisation starts to upscale, systems become more complex, thorough in depth risk assessments, business continuity assessment, ROI calculations are ndded in order to stay compliant and feasible.

<h1>Information Security Policies</h1>

Within the checklist, there are 3 sections under Information Security Policies: Security Policies existing, Policies approved by management and Evidence of compliance

We can see from above image, we have configured security policies as per before compliant to ML1 E8 with the exception of MFA and regular backup. This can be done through the server's cloud/server management of systems. The policies have also been approved by executives such as CISO, CIO.

<h2>Organisational Compliance</h2>
Within this section, ISO27001 outlines how the organisation should segregate duties, apply zero trust and contact with external vendors in term of software and compliance.

Within this specific organisation, roles are specifically defined per team member, their roles are segregated as per their work and this will determine what type of resources they are allowed to access.

There is also contact with authorities such as a ISO27001 certified auditor or a PCI QSA (PCI Qualified Security Assessor) if the organisation does handle confidential customer data.

External vendor contacts and information security is not yet marked as compliant, as external negotiation with vendors still in place and lengthy discussions and meetings with project manager about information security within the scope of the project wwill be held to ensure compliance.

Mobile devices are compliant with ISO27001 standard, employees are to use them for work purposes only and a VPN connection for the phone is always active to ensure confidentialty and integrity.

Remote desktop policies are currently being discussed with executives and proper security controls are to be implemented before remote desktop is allowed for remote employees, for the time being, they are to use work-provded phone and laptops to conduct work outside of the office.

<h3>New Hires</h3>

ISO27001 also has a section about new hired members for the company and what checks must be done for the organisation to stay compliant.

![ISO HR](https://github.com/BYeungCyberSec/MockAudit/assets/150320582/4ada5a4b-596b-4055-aef4-ff958eb2dde7)

Screening is in place, and depending on what type of employee is being hired and the sector of the work being done in, they may need certain certifications (i.e DoD 8570 requiring Security+ or another relevant certificate)

There is no well set defined policy for HR in terms of employment as the company is still growing, a baseline security clearance is being discussed for future employees to be able to obtain before employment and for current employees to obtain as well.
