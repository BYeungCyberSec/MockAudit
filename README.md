# MockAudit

In this project, I have configured a Windows 10 VM to be ML1 Essential 8 compliant outside of Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) and backup of data as this VM can be easily cloned if re-imaging is needed.

There will be 2 main sections in this lab that will be explored:

[Configuration of Windows 10 VM via a STIG Tool](https://github.com/BYeungCyberSec/MockAudit/blob/main/Windows10.md) ( credits to https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Windows-Optimize-Harden-Debloat-GUI for STIG tool )

[ISO27001 mock audit](https://github.com/BYeungCyberSec/MockAudit/blob/main/ISO27001MockAudit.md) ( checklist against an imaginary small startup company )
